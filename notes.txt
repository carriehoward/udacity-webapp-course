===========

Structured Query Languages (SQL) were invented in 1970's and it was way before
the invention of WWW.

Google App Engine.

Entities are like tables whose columns are not fixed.

Tables -> Entities
            -> Columns are not fixed.
            -> All have an ID.
            -> have a notion of parents/ ancestors.
                (Reddit -> Link)
SQL -> GQL
    -> All queries being with select * (no queries begin with individual columns)
Run arbitrary query -> All queries must be indexed.

Datastore is sharded and replicated.
