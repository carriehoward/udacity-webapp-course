Class Notes
===========

Structured Query Languages (SQL) were invented in 1970's and it was way before
the invention of WWW.

Google App Engine.

Entities are like tables whose columns are not fixed.

Tables -> Entities
            -> Columns are not fixed.
            -> All have an ID.
            -> have a notion of parents/ ancestors.
                (Reddit -> Link)
SQL -> GQL
    -> All queries being with select * (no queries begin with individual columns)
Run arbitrary query -> All queries must be indexed.

Datastore is sharded and replicated.

Datastore types include string and text, the difference being, the string type
has to be under 500 characters and it is index and text type can have more than
500 characters.

In database terminology, cursor is nothing but a pointer to the result.

There is something about cookies.

The difference between using add_header and then using headers as a dictionary
is, if you use headers as a dictionary, the next item can overwrite it. We do
not want that happen.

And in headers, it is important to remember that multiple headers can have the
same name.

bcrypt is the best hash function out there.
